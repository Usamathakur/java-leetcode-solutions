# java-leetcode-solutions
I will try my best to solve leetcode easy + medium + hard problems with Java. 

My Suggestion is you use this code only as a reference only. Do not copy and paste it don't fool yourself. Learn about the problem it's algorithm and then try on your own with paper and pen. I know it will be wrong at first but you can look at the solutions above and see if you can do it on your own if you tried 5-6 times and the leetcode won't accept just copy and paste my code and see what you did wrong. 

Hope you will be consistent and I will do my best to practice everyday. 

Thank You!
